### Questions
Here I'll answer some questions about the project preemptively

#### Why not fork Jellyfin, a project that intends to have the same goal?
During my personal experience moving from Plex to Jellyfin I encountered a few hurdles and friction that eft me less than satisfied.
Not to say Jellyfin isn't an amazing project because it is and will be probably superior to this project for a very long time, but I would like to re-invent the wheel and create something aesthetically pleasing, fast, and written in Golang.
